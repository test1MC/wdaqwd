        <h2 class="Heading2">Workstation Setup</h2>
        <p class="BodyText">Workstations are computers that are used to access application functionality for the SmartSuite system. Workstations are most commonly traditional personal computers (PCs), but can also be handheld devices, industrialized computers or other types of equipment.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Workstation settings allow System Administrators to configure SmartSuite Workstations and Workstation Groups (i.e. multiple workstations performing the same or similar tasks). </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The Workstation Administration functions in the SmartSuite Web Client are accessed via the Field Devices section of the Settings menu. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Workstation groups are configured for each Workstation Type (i.e. MECs). Each physical workstation must belong to a workstation group and be configured as a particular workstation.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Workstation groups are used to simplify workstation configuration by applying the same business rules to all workstations in the same group. Workstations and workstation groups can be added, edited, copied, or deleted. The Workstations and Workstation Groups Setup screens allow an administrator to manage the workstations for the system.</p>
