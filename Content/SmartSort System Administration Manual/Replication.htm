        <h3 class="Heading3">Replication</h3>
        <p class="BodyText">Replication is a service built into SQL Server that allows data from one database to be copied and synchronized with one or more other databases.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The SmartSort BHS uses Transactional Replication to copy data from the SAC to the DHS. Replication is also used to copy data from the DHS servers to the DHS server. As each operation (or transaction) is performed on the SAC, the same transaction is performed on the DHS, then, as that transaction is performed on the DHS, that transaction is performed on the DHS. Additional data for reports is also generated on the DHS, but this data is not copied back to the SAC. Replication only goes one direction. The time required to propagate information through the replication is usually very small (a few seconds). </p>
