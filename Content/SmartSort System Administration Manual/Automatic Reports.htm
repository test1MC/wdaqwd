        <h3 class="Heading3">Automatic Reports</h3>
        <p class="BodyText">The various reports available in the Web Client can be automatically generated at particular times each day. This functionality is managed from the <span class="Bold">Automatic Reports</span> screen, accessed via the <span class="Bold">Settings</span> menu. The user can schedule recurring jobs that export specific reports to specific destinations (i.e. to a printer or to a file). Jobs can have one or more reports associated with them. Each report is configured using the Report Generation parameters as well as a set of output destinations that can be customized for each report.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Typically, a report will have only two parameters (Start Time and End Time), but some reports have additional parameters. The report parameters that can be entered on the <span class="Bold">Automatic Reports</span> screen are identical to those that can be entered when generating the reports themselves via the Web Client.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each Automatic Report Job is only executed once a day. Automatic Report Jobs can be added, edited, and deleted. Report outputs can also be added, edited, and deleted.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">A default job is configured to export all reports each night to a folder on the DHS where they are stored.</p>
