        <p class="BodyText">Each of the FormsClient machines in the BHS is created from the same image (located on the NAS at <span class="Hyperlink">\\DFW-D-NAS\DFW\FormsClient\</span>). For a fresh computer, or to repair an existing one, the process is described below.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Hardware requirements:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1">USB Drive with the Redo software on it (either supplied by Brock Solutions, or make your own using the instructions at <a href="http://www.redobackup.org/download.php"><span class="Hyperlink">www.redobackup.org/download.php</span></a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1">Another USB Drive containing the Image from the NAS (no special instructions for this drive). You can also image from the NAS, but this is much slower and requires setting up the IP address within the Redo software. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1">ELO touch screen and USB keyboard. If no touchscreen is available, connect a USB mouse as well for convenience. </li>

            <li class="List">Plug in the ELO monitor (DVI), USB key with Redo, USB drive with image, touchscreen USB, and a USB keyboard. Then connect power and the machine will boot. Leave the network cable unplugged. </li>
