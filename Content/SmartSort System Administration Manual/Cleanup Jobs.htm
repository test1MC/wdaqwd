        <h4 class="Heading4">Cleanup Jobs</h4>
        <p class="BodyText">Other jobs are used to clean up data nightly as listed and described in this section. The schedules of each are staggered to avoid overlapped processing, but take place between 01:00 and 03:00 in the morning. These jobs do add load to the servers during this period, but not enough to prevent proper system function at the same time. </p>
        <p class="Subheading">Cleanup Log Files</p>
        <p class="BodyText">All log files in the computer's log file directory are moved to a Log File Archive directory on the server D:\ drives. Each day, each server generates a single zip file of all logs. These zipped files are deleted after a few months. </p>
        <p class="Subheading">SQL Maintenance Plan</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1">Cleanup SAC Data and Cleanup DHS Data: These two jobs go through their respective database and remove all records that are older than the retention periods (configurable on the Web Client Facility <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">described in section <MadCap:xref href="System Settings.htm#_Ref456258453" class="ParaTextOnly">2.3.1 System Management</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText>). This includes stale BSMs, Bag Records, Bag Transactions, Raw Messages, Statistical Data, SAM and MEC Statistics, Flight History, and any other non-configuration data. Part of this process also involves summarizing statistics counts into daily groups for long-term reports and moving bag records into historical data tables on the DHS. </li>

        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1">DBBackup / Maintenance: This job creates a full backup of the database and deletes old database backups. SQL backups are retained for only a few days before deletion due to their size. Some internal SQL log data is also cleaned up by this job.</li>
