        <p class="BodyText">Shutting down or restarting a BHS virtual server should be undertaken with care to avoid affecting live operations, or in conjunction with Brock Solutions support. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">For all the virtual servers and the maintenance server, the process for shutting down or restarting is not complex. Simply use the Windows commands for reboot or shutdown: either from the top right corner of the full-screen start menu, or by right-clicking on the start button and using the context menu. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">When rebooting an individual server, Windows can be used exclusively. If the server is shut down, vCenter must be used to restart it (see <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">section </MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:xref href="Power on off startup shutdown.htm#_Ref455065674" class="ParaTextOnly">3.1.2.2.2 Power on/off, startup/shutdown</MadCap:xref>), as that is the only way to access powered-off virtual machines. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">If the entire BHS needs to be shut down, the order of powering off VMs is not important, but there are some notes for rebooting (see also the next section). The only important dependency between virtual machines is that vCenter needs the domain to be active before it can fully boot up. Consequently, manual reboots should power off the primary domain controller (BHS-DC01) last and boot it up first. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">If vCenter is not available (because it has been shut down), the vSphere thick client can be used to connect directly to one of the host servers (using local credentials) as noted in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">the topic,</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">section </MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:xref href="Logging In.htm#_Ref455065696" class="ParaTextOnly">3.1.2.1.1 Logging In</MadCap:xref>. Power options are shown in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">the topic</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">section </MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:xref href="View Information about a VM.htm#_Ref455065715" class="ParaTextOnly">3.1.2.1.2 View Information about a VM</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The virtual machines are shown in a tree similar to the Web Client and can be powered on in much the same fashion. Only the virtual machines associated with a host are seen in the vSphere client for that host (not the full system). Connect to each host in turn until the correct VM is located if the state was not observed before shutdown. </p>

        <p class="BodyText">The figure above shows the comparison between connecting to vCenter (which manages all hosts and VMs), and an individual host which has only shows the VMs owned by the host. Logging on to a host displays a message saying that changes will not be propagated (only powering on or off VMs should be performed). </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The order of shutting down virtual servers is outlined below (there is no need to wait in between each). Reboots can follow in the opposite order (bottom-up, also no need to wait between starting machines): </p>
