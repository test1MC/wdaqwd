        <p class="BodyText">Sortation Assignments are managed through a virtual to physical mapping table. Instead of assigning a flight to a physical sort destination, such as a make-up unit (which could become unavailable), flights are instead assigned to a virtual sort destination. Usually the virtual sort destinations are identical to the physical sort destination (i.e. the virtual sort destination"MU01" would be assigned to the physical sort destination "MU01"). However, in cases of equipment failure, flight cancellations, etc., all bags can be easily rerouted by "remapping" the "MU01" virtual sort destination to another physical make-up unit (e.g. MU02). </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Virtual sort destination assignments are also used by the system to handle special cases such as No Read bags. These special virtual sort destinations cannot be assigned to a flight, but they can be assigned to route bags to a specific destination. For example, in a system that has a Manual Encoding Station, any "No Read" or "Reject" bags are normally sent to the MEC, but these locations could also be re-mapped elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Special virtual destinations are configured by the system administrator <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">(section <MadCap:xref href="Virtual Makeup Units.htm#_Ref452540842" class="ParaTextOnly">2.4.9 Virtual Makeup Unit Configuration</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText> and may include the following:</p>

        <p class="Subheading">To configure virtual make-up unit assignments:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">Select the relevant Physical make-up unit from the <span class="Bold">Physical Makeup Units</span> list. The details for that Physical make-up unit are displayed in the <span class="Bold">Physical Makeup Unit Details</span> section of the screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">To add a Virtual Make-up Unit Mapping, select a make-up unit from the <span class="Bold">[Add Virtual Makeup unit] </span>drop-down list. Note that the makeup unit is automatically added to the Virtual to Physical Mapping table, but the Virtual to Physical Mapping must be saved before the change takes effect in the sortation system.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">To remove a Virtual Makeup Unit Mapping, select the checkbox beside the desired makeup unit(s) and click <span class="Bold">Remove</span>. Clicking the checkbox in the header row of the Virtual Makeup units table selects all virtual makeup units. Note that the makeup unit is automatically removed from the Virtual to Physical Mapping table, but the Virtual to Physical Mapping must be saved before the change takes effect in the sortation system. If this is the last copy of a Virtual makeup unit in the mapping, it appears as a No Makeup unit (Unassigned) mapping. </li>

            <li class="List">To copy a virtual makeup unit to another physical makeup unit or to move a virtual makeup unit to another physical makeup unit, select the checkbox beside the desired makeup unit(s) and then select the physical makeup unit from the <span class="Bold">[Move/Copy To] </span>drop-down list. From the Move/Copy dialog that is displayed, select the <span class="Bold">Copy</span> checkbox or the <span class="Bold">Move</span> button as desired. In normal circumstances, <span class="Bold">Move</span> is the desired option. <span class="Bold">Copy</span> creates a round-robin effect for the virtual makeup unit. </li>
