        <h4 class="Heading4">Manual Encode Consoles (MEC)</h4>
        <p class="BodyText">The MECs are used to sort bags that cannot be automatically sorted by the system.&#160; All existing Manual Encode Consoles (MEC) have been replaced with new computer hardware and enclosures.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The Manual Encoding Console (MEC) is composed of an industrial computer with a touch screen and a Hand-Held Scanner. A mouse and keyboard are not attached under normal operations - all of the MEC functions can be performed using the touch screen interface. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The MEC allows for manual sortation of bags which are not read at the ATR and for bags which are read properly by the ATR but must be manually handled for some other reason (e.g. Tag Conflict, No BSM, or Flight not in Schedule, etc.). </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The MEC provides a method to manually assign bag destinations, and also acts as a backup sorting machine if an ATR Scanner and/or Servers fail.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each MEC communicates directly with both the PLC and the SAC, in both cases over the Ethernet network. When a bag has reached the encoding position on the appropriate conveyor line, the operator can begin encoding operations by attempting to hand scan the baggage tag barcode. If this is not possible, or does not result in a sort decision, the operator also has the ability to manually enter the barcode or other destination information.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The configuration information for the MEC is stored in several database tables located on the SAC. The information is keyed to the Computer Name of the workstation. This allows a replacement to be deployed to any station merely by altering the computer name and network.</p>
