        <p class="BodyText">This section describes the software services that run on the SAC and DHS servers. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The services are divided across the two servers. Most services on the SAC are directly related to sortation, while those on the DHS are used for reporting or diagnostics. The DHS communicates through OPC with the PLC for many services, while the SAC communicates via Ethernet/IP to the upper-level.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">All services should be running at all times for proper functioning of the BHS. Each service has its own area of responsibility and the effect of stopping a service may not be immediately noticeable, but all services are important. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The figures below display the services installed on the servers as viewed through the SmartSort Service Manager. Each of the services is described in the following sections which provide details about what the service does, why it is important, and how to determine if it is not functioning correctly. </p>
