        <p class="BodyText">&lt;Insert description of the system overview here - is this a replacement, expansion, etc. What components does it include? Is it a sortation system or an inbound system or just a CBIS system? How are bags sorted?</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Example:</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The existing SmartSort software and upper level fault monitoring system was updated to include the new CBIS conveyors and equipment.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The upper level control system is controlled by Brock Solutions' SmartSort system, which consists of redundant sort allocation controllers, data historian servers, and user work stations.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The lower level control system is controlled by Allen-Bradley PLCs programmed with Brock Solutions' standard PLC code. There are four (4) new PLC redundant pairs and fourteen (14) new Motor Control Panels (MCPs). For full details about operating and maintaining the lower-level control systems, refer to the Controls Operations and Maintenance Manual.&gt;</p>
