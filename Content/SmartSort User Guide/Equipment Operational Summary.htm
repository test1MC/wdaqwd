        <p class="BodyText">The Equipment Operational Summary Report is a single report with sub-sections for each type of equipment that was selected (e.g. Photo Eyes, Diverters, etc.). By default, the report will show details for all devices; however, the operator can select which types of devices should be included in the report. For certain devices, the operator can also select the subsystems for which statistics will be displayed. The operator can also configure thresholds for certain data (to exclude zero counts and/or low counts for certain devices.</p>
        <p class="Subheading">The following selection criteria are available:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1">Start Date and Time</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1">End Date and Time</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Include Photo eyes with Zero Jams </span>– If selected, the statistics for all jam photo eyes will be displayed even if no jams were detected.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Threshold Values</span> – Entering a number in the <span class="Bold">Threshold</span> field will set the maximum statistics that will be displayed for the selected equipment. By default, no thresholds are selected (so that there are no limits on the results).</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Equipment Type and Equipment Subsystem Filters</span> – Breaks up the equipment in the report by type of equipment and by zone/conveyor line.</li>
