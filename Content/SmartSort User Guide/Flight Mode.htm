        <p class="BodyText">The user can choose to encode a bag by flight. The flight schedule is available in tabular form with one row for each flight. Not all the flights will be displayed on the screen at once. However, the list of flights can be filtered by Carrier, Flight Number, or Route using the keyboard at the bottom of the screen. The user can browse through the list of flights using the First, Last, and Paging buttons. Alternatively, clicking on the column headers will sort the table by the column. To return to the default sort order (by flight), click the Clear button at the bottom left of the keyboard. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The flights that are displayed are a subset of the flights in the Active Flight Schedule. A search window is used to find flights based on their scheduled departure time. The window is typically configured to look for flights that were scheduled to depart within the last 60 minutes or within the next few hours. </p>

        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">Tap <span class="Bold">Flight</span>. When Flight Mode is selected, the button will be light blue. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">Select the desired flight from the flight list. The flights that are displayed can be filtered by carrier code, flight number, or route (destination airport code) by using the on-screen keyboard and key pad.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="SubBullet_1">
            <li class="SubBullet_1">If there are multiple piers assigned for the current time-period (e.g. multiple time-based piers with different criteria or special pier categories are in use), all relevant piers will be displayed once the flight has been selected. The user must choose the desired pier. The Sort Destination column will show an ellipsis (…) when multiple piers are assigned.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">Tap <span class="Bold">Release</span>. The bag will be sent to the relevant time-based pier based on the current time and flight's schedule. Once released, the MEC will send the bag's destination to the PLC which will route the bag and the bag transaction data will be updated on the SAC. </li>
