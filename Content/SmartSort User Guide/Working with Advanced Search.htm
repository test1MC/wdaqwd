        <p class="BodyText">Once a search is processed, the search results are displayed (any database records matching the search criteria will be displayed). The columns that are displayed in the search results can be changed by clicking on the <span class="Bold">Columns</span> list item. All column titles that are selected will be displayed. If any columns are not displayed, they will also be excluded from the exported report results.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <span class="Bold">Apply</span> to apply any changes. If the display columns are modified after the search has been performed, the changes will not be displayed in the search results until the search has been either refreshed or regenerated.</p>

        <p class="BodyText">There are several functions available once search results have been generated. If multiple pages of search results are generated, there are controls to go forward, backward, or to a particular page. Note that some of these buttons will be grayed out if they do not apply (e.g. if there is only one page of results, all of these buttons will be unavailable).</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The search results can also be sorted (ascending or descending) by any column. To sort the results, click on a column heading. When the results are being sorted by column the direction of the sort (ascending or descending) is indicated by an arrow icon. </p>

        <p class="BodyText">A text search can be performed on the search results by typing search parameters into the <span class="Bold">Find</span> text box and clicking <span class="Bold">Find</span>. Additional search results can be viewed by clicking <span class="Bold">Next</span>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Search results can also be refreshed by clicking on the Refresh icon. Refreshing the search results will retrieve any new records that have been added to the database since the search was originally generated. Note: If any search criteria are changed, clicking the refresh icon will not regenerate the search - the <span class="Bold">Search</span> button must be clicked to regenerate the search in this case.</p>
