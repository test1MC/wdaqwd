        <h2 class="Heading2">Inspecting a Bag</h2>
        <p class="BodyText">Each inspection table has a BIT terminal. These terminals allow users to view the details of the bag arriving for processing. The BIT transfers data to the SVS so that the officer can see the x-ray image of the bag captured by the screening machines.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">BIT Terminals are used to send the Baggage ID information that was transferred from the BRP station to the associated SVS (ISD Analysis Computer). The SVS is used to retrieve the ISD scan information about the bag. The Baggage ID information is transferred from the BIT to the SVS using Baggage Automatic ID Transfer (BAIT) and is used to assist the user in searching the bag.</p>
