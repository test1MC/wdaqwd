        <h5 class="Heading5">Temporarily Overriding the Time Range</h5>
        <p class="BodyText">The user can temporarily change the Time Range to be different than what is specified in the default display settings by clicking the <span class="Bold">Edit</span> button next to the Time Range and modifying the start time and end time. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The start date/time and end date/time can be manually specified. Clicking <span class="Bold">Apply</span> will apply the selected time/date range and display flights whose departure times fall within that range. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Clicking <span class="Bold">Default</span> will reset the time range to the user's configured time range setting. Note that when the Time Range is overridden, it will remain in effect as long as one of the views of the Active Flight Schedule displays. If the user navigates to a different screen and then back to the Active Flight Schedule, the user's Default Time Range will be used again.</p>

        <p class="Subheading">Modifying Display Filters</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The flights that are displayed on the Active Flight schedule screen can also be filtered based on several flight properties. When multiple filters are added, only flights that match all of the filters will be displayed. Note that for multi-value filters, flights only need to match one value from the list of filters for that flight property. For example, specifying ZZ and YY for Airline and A1 for Gate will find all flights that have an Airline of <span class="Bold">either</span> ZZ <span class="Bold">or</span> YY <span class="Bold">and</span> the flight's Gate contains A1. Note that the filters remain when switching between the three views, but can be removed at any time.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To remove all filters specified, click <span class="Bold">Clear Filters</span>.</p>
