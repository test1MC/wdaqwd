        <p class="BodyText">There are several functions available once a report has been generated. If the report has multiple pages, there are controls to go forward, backward, or to a particular page. Note that some of these buttons will be greyed out if they do not apply (e.g. if there is only one page in a report, all of these buttons will be unavailable).</p>
        <p class="BodyText">For some reports, the report can also be sorted by a particular column (ascending or descending). To sort the results, click the up/down arrow icon next to a column heading. When the results are being sorted by column, the direction of the sort (ascending or descending) is indicated by an arrow icon.</p>

        <p class="BodyText">A text search can be performed on the report results by typing search parameters into the Find text box and clicking the <span class="Bold">Find</span> link. Additional search results can be viewed by clicking the <span class="Bold">Next</span> button.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Report results can also be refreshed by clicking on the <span class="Bold">Refresh</span> icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/TL6015 SmartSort User Guide/Working with Report Results_1.png" style="height: 18px;width: 16px;" class="img_1" />). Refreshing the report will retrieve any new records that have been added to the database since the report was originally generated. Note: If any report criteria are changed, clicking the refresh icon will not regenerate the report – the <span class="Bold">Generate </span>button must be pressed to regenerate the report in this case.</p>
