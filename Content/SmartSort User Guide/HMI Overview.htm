        <h1 class="Heading1">HMI Overview</h1>
        <p class="BodyText">The HMI is the primary means of monitoring the status of the system (i.e. viewing the current status of system devices). The HMI displays, in both graphical and textual format, an overview of the mechanical system, showing component status information (such as which conveyors are running, which devices are faulted, etc.). The information is updated in near-real-time by the PLCs.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">A single application has been developed with a supported resolution of 1920 x 1080. The HMI application is configured to display a certain set of screens by default when it is launched. However, the application is flexible in that any HMI screen can be displayed on any of the monitors.</p>
