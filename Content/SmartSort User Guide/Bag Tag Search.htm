        <h3 class="Heading3">Bag Tag Search</h3>
        <p class="BodyText">The Bag Tag Search screen allows the operator to search for baggage records. This table contains one record per bag. However, it may contain many records with the same bag tag (because of the roll-over of IATA numbers). Multiple records of the same bag tag number display if BSMs were received for the associated bag at multiple stations. Note that the time zone associated with the timestamp returned in the search results is indicated in the top right corner of the screen. Station-specific data is filtered to only display information the user has permission to view. For example, a user that does not have permission to access information related to any of the stations associated with a bag's itinerary will not be able to successfully query associated baggage records. Bag tag search results are station-specific based on BSMs received; if a BSM is received from other stations for a specific tag number, these results will also display, provided the user has the appropriate permission.</p>
