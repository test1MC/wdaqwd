        <p class="BodyText">When a bag arrives, and stops at the associated queue photo eye, the bag data along with the Bag Security Status displays. The bag information that the BRP can display includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Bag Pseudo ID</span> - The PLC-generated value passed to the ISD to associate with the image (used when no other ID is available).</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">IATA Bag Tag Number</span> - If the bag had a readable barcode, it will be passed to the ISD to associate with the image (if no ATRs are installed upstream of screening, this field will be hidden).</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">RFID Tag Number</span> - If the bag had a readable barcode, it will be passed to the ISD to associate with the image (if no readers are installed upstream of screening, this field will be hidden).</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">ISD Machine</span> - The device that screened the bag.</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">BHS ID for the Bag</span> - The PLC ID used for tracking the bag in the system (can be used for bag research from the SmartSuite Enterprise Web Client).</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Photo Eye</span> - Certain bag statuses displays the photo eye where the bag began to be tracked by the PLC.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">The Bag Security Status is indicated with a color associated with the security status. The colors and statuses are defined in PGDS. These colors and statuses are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Cleared (Green)</span> - The bag was cleared by the ISD or through OSR. Bags should rarely arrive in CBRA with a Cleared status.</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Alarmed (Red)</span> - The bag was not cleared by the ISD or through OSR.</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">ISD Unknown (Yellow)</span> - The bag either received a decision of "Error" from the ISD or did not receive any response at all.</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">BHS Unknown (Blue)</span> - The bag was lost in tracking.</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Out of Gauge (Orange)</span> - The bag in question was small enough to be conveyed by the conveyor equipment but was too large for the ISD.</li>

The availability of each BIT station displays on the screen. All BIT stations that are not available will have a gray background.

The primary BIT station (the one located nearest to BRP stations) will be larger and will be indicated as the default BIT station.</p>

        <p class="BodyText">The SmartSuite Enterprise Web Client is used to configure the BIT stations that are associated with each BRP station (including which BIT station will be the default). For more information, refer to the SmartSort System Administration Manual Chapter 2: SmartSuite Enterprise Web Client Administration.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Once a BIT station is selected, the user has a certain amount of time to remove the bag from the associated queue photo eye and physically transfer it to the BIT station. A timer displays on the BRP workstation to let the user know how much time is remaining to transfer the bag. If the bag is not transferred in time, the transfer will automatically be cancelled. The user can also manually cancel the transfer at any time by clicking <span class="Bold">Cancel</span>.</p>
