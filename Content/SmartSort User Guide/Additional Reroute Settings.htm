        <p class="BodyText">The <span class="Bold">Reroute Type Settings</span> section of the <span class="Bold">Reroute Groups</span> screen is used to configure the reroute mode that will be used in four different reroute scenarios by type of bag (early, missed, cancelled). Each scenario is described below. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">For information about the reroute modes that can be selected, refer to section <MadCap:xref href="Reroute Modes.htm#_Ref334529984" class="ParaTextOnly">4.4.1 Reroute Modes</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Sent to Reroute Previously</span> – If a bag was previously sent to its sort destination via Dynamic Reroute and the bag is seen in the system again, the system can be configured to route the bag using the next reroute method in the list (e.g. Group Default Pier). This setting is used to handle the scenario where baggage handlers will re-induct the bag back into the system because the handler believes the bag should not have been delivered to that pier. In this case, the sortation logic would not continuously send the bag back to a Dynamic Reroute pier each time it is seen.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Bag has Onward Flight</span> – For each reroute group, the system can be configured to handle bags differently depending on whether the bag has one or more onward flights specified in the BSM (e.g. bag will go to station A via flight 1234 and then station B via flight 5678). The reroute method can be configured separately for bags with onward flights and bags with no onward flights. For example, bags with no onward flights may be configured to reroute bags using the Dynamic Reroute sort method while bags with onward flights could be configured to route to the Default Reroute Pier. The latter handles the scenario where some sort of user intervention may be able to determine a better route to the final destination than can be determined by SmartSort (which only knows the local airport's flight schedule). For example, there may be a route via another station that would allow the bag to arrive at the final destination much quicker than a flight from the station that routes to the final destination.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Bag has no Onward Flight</span> – The reroute mode defined for bags with no onward flights will only impact bags that have a single destination specified in the BSM (e.g. bag will go directly to station B via flight 5678). For information about why it might be desirable to handle bags with onward flights differently, see the previous criteria description.</li>
