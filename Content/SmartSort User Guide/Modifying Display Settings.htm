        <p class="BodyText">There are user-specific display settings available for the Active Flight Schedule that determine what data is displayed including the time range and whether or not the data automatically refreshes. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Whatever settings are configured will be saved for the user automatically and applied during any subsequent log ins. To access the settings, click the <span class="Bold">Settings</span> button in the schedule controls section of the screen. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">For information about temporarily overriding the time range settings, see section <MadCap:xref href="Temporarily Overriding the Time Range.htm#_Ref443906030" class="ParaTextOnly">4.3.2.2.1 Temporarily Overriding the Time Range</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <p class="BodyText">The following settings are available:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Default Time Range</span> – This defines what range in time is displayed by default when the user visits the page. Only flights whose Estimated Departure time is within the selected time range will be displayed. The time range can be configured as a fixed time period on the current day (from 02:00 until 23:00, for example) or as a rolling time period (two hours before the current time and four hours after the current time, for example). Initially, the default time range is configured to be a fixed time range from 03:00 until 03:00, where 03:00 is the rollover time.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Auto Refresh</span> – This determines whether or not the page will automatically refresh the flights that are displayed. By default, Auto-Refresh is On and set to a value of 30 seconds. When auto refresh is off, if any new flights are added or if any flight times change, those changes are not reflected on the screen. Likewise, if the display is configured for a rolling time period and auto-refresh is turned off, the time period displayed will be an offset from the time the page was originally loaded as opposed to the current time. Auto-Refresh is available for the List and Gantt views only. While in the Editor view, the page will never refresh. When Auto Refresh is turned on, the refresh time can be specified in seconds.</li>
