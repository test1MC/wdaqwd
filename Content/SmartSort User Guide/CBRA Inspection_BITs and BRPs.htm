        </h1>
        <p class="BodyText">Baggage Removal Point (BRP) terminals and Baggage Inspection Table (BIT) terminals are in the Checked Baggage Resolution Area (CBRA) and are used to assist users in the inspection of bags that are not cleared automatically by security screening. Bags will also be sent to the CBRA area if they are too large to be processed using the Inline Screening Devices (ISDs) or if they are lost in tracking between being processed by the ISDs and being diverted to the "cleared" portion of the sortation system.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">In general terms, the CBRA Inspection process is described below:</p>
        <ol class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">A bag is sent to the CBRA area.</li>
            <li class="List">The bag is delivered to an available BRP terminal<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> (for details about how the system determines which available BRP is used, refer to Brock Solutions Controls Manual Chapter 3: System Level Controls</MadCap:conditionalText>.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="SubBullet_1">In contingency operations, bags will stop at the first BRP station and a bag tag can be printed for each bag.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">The agent uses the BRP application to select an available BIT workstation. This is the workstation to which the bag will be transferred.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="SubBullet_1">In contingency operations the user can also remove the bag without selecting a BIT workstation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="4" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">The agent removes the bag from the conveyor and transfers it to the selected BIT workstation.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="SubBullet_1">If the bag is not removed within the configured time limit, the transfer will be cancelled.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1"> The transfer can also be cancelled by the agent at any time if the wrong BIT was selected or the bag does not need to be removed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="5" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">Once removed from the conveyor, the bag's data displays on the selected BIT terminal.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="6" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">The agent uses the BIT application to view the associated SVS data for the bag (the information associated with the ISD image).</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="7" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">The agent follows SOP for reconciling the bag by sending it back to be scanned by the ISD machine or dealing with it on the table.</li>
