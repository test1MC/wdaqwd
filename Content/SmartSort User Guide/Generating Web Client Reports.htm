        <p class="BodyText">The report screens allow an operator to query the DHS database for baggage, flight, and alarm records that meet a given set of criteria. The data is returned as a pre-formatted report. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each of the Reports screens behaves in the same manner: report criteria are selected, and the report is generated. A time and date range is required for most reports. Some reports have additional report criteria that can be selected. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Once a report is generated, the report results can be printed, or exported to file (CSV, PDF, Excel). The report criteria can also be modified and a new report can be generated at any time.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each Report in the Web Client has a Report Criteria screen, from which the various criteria defining the search are selected. For most reports, only a time/date range is required. However, some reports have additional criteria such as intervals, equipment type, etc.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Once the Report Criteria have been selected, click <span class="Bold">Generate</span> to generate the report. The report will be displayed on the right side of the screen.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Reports can be generated in report viewer format, or in PDF format. By default, the report will be displayed in the Report Viewer format. Results from the Report Viewer can be sorted<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> (see section <MadCap:xref href="Working with Report Results.htm#_Ref450731188" class="ParaTextOnly">9.1.1 Working with Report Results</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText> or printed/exported<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> (see section <MadCap:xref href="Printing Exporting Reports.htm#_Ref450731202" class="ParaTextOnly">9.1.2 Printing/Exporting Reports</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Clicking the <span class="Bold">PDF</span> radio button will generate the report results in a PDF format and open the results in Acrobat Reader. The results will still be displayed in the same Web Client window, but the options to print, save, and navigate are controlled through the version of Acrobat installed on the computer where the report was executed.</p>
        <p class="Subheading">To generate a report: </p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">Select the desired report from the <span class="Bold">Reports</span> menu.</li>

        <ol start="2" class="ol_1">
            <li class="List">Enter the report criteria.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1">Most reports only require a time and date range; however, some reports require other criteria. Each report screen will indicate which criteria are optional. Attempting to generate a report without one of mandatory criteria will return an error message.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1"><span class="Bold">Note:</span> When generating multiple reports for a shift or time period, it can be helpful to use the same time and date criteria that was used for the most recently generated report. To use the previous report's time and date criteria, click the <span class="Bold">Use Previous</span> time and date range link below the other date criteria fields. The <span class="Bold">Use Previous</span> link displays for any report that uses a date range or a date time range.<br /> <img src="../Resources/Images/Generating Web Client Reports.png" style="width: 300px;height: 251px;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" /></li>
