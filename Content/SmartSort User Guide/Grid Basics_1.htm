        <h5 class="Heading5">Grid Basics</h5>
        <p class="BodyText">This section describes how to interact with the grid in the Editor view. The following functions are available:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Copy/Paste</span> – Each cell/selection can be copy and pasted with the keyboard using <span class="Bold">CTRL+C</span> and <span class="Bold">CTRL+V</span> respectively. Alternately, if copying cells in rows adjacent to one another, click the cell that contains the data that should be copied and then grab the handle on the bottom right corner of the cell and drag down across any cells that should have the same value.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Multiple Selection</span> – Multiple rows/cells can be selected at a time to perform a command on (described later) or copy from. Multiple selections can be achieved in one of two ways:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="SubBullet_1">Click any cell, hold the <span class="Bold">Shift</span> key, and then click on another cell. All the cells in between the two clicked cells will be highlighted. For example, if you click on a cell in the first row of the first column and then hold the Shift key and click on the seventh row in the third column, all the cells from column 1 to 3 and row 1 to 7 will be highlighted/selected.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1">Click any cell, keep the mouse button held down, and drag the mouse to any other cell, and then release the mouse button. All the cells in between will be highlighted/selected.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1">Click a row number to select an entire row or click a column header to select an entire column.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Inline Editing</span> – Each cell can be manually edited. Some cells contain drop-down lists (e.g. Airline). Note that date and time fields must be entered in the format of yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm (e.g. 2015-12-25 01:30). The time must be entered in 24:00 format.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Pier Editing </span>– A single pier can be assigned for all bags for a flight by typing the pier name. Optionally a station and/or class can be added to a pier assignment. To configure the pier based on station and/or class, the pier information must be formatted as follows (with commas separating additional pier assignments):</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="SubBullet_1">PierName/Station/Class</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1">PierName/Station/Class, PierName/Station/Class, etc.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1">An example complicated pier assignment might look like the following:<br />SP2/YYZ/Y, SP3/YYZ/Z, SP1, SP2//G, SP2/YVR<br />This would result in a pier assignment that looks like the following:<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/SmartSort User Guide/pier assignment.png" /></li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Adding Flights </span>– There is always an empty row at the bottom of the grid that can be used to add a new flight. One or more flights can also be pasted to the last row or duplicated from other existing flights. Lastly, the <span class="Bold">Add Flight</span> button can be used to add a new flight<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> (see section <MadCap:xref href="Adding a Flight to the Flight Schedule Template.htm#_Ref446324270" class="ParaTextOnly">4.3.3.2.7 Adding a Flight to the Flight Schedule Template</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. Note that the flight will not actually be added to the flight schedule template until the <span class="Bold">Save All </span>button is pressed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Deleting Flights</span> – One or more flights can be deleted by selecting the entire row and hitting the delete key. The entire row is selected by clicking the row number on the left side of the grid. The <span class="Bold">Delete</span> button can also be used to delete a flight<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> (see section <MadCap:xref href="Deleting a Flight from the Flight Schedule Template.htm#_Ref446324366" class="ParaTextOnly">4.3.3.2.10 Deleting a Flight from the Flight Schedule Template</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>.

        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Editing Flights</span> – Individual flights can be edited by modifying the text in the grid or by clicking on the Flight Number in the grid, which will display the Edit Flight dialog. The Edit Flight dialog can also be displayed by clicking the <span class="Bold">Edit Flight </span>button<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> (see section <MadCap:xref href="Editing a Flight in the Flight Schedule Template.htm#_Ref446324390" class="ParaTextOnly">4.3.3.2.8 Editing a Flight in the Flight Schedule Template</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>.

        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Duplicating Flights</span> – One or more rows can be duplicated by selecting the entire row and clicking the <span class="Bold">Duplicate</span> button.

        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Row and Cell Validation</span> – When data is entered or edits are made, rows and cells are validated. If there is an issue with a cell, the cell is highlighted in red and an error message is displayed in the Status column. Rows cannot be saved when errors are present - if the <span class="Bold">Save All</span> button is clicked any other changes will be saved, but not the invalid rows. If there is a flight without a proper On Time Pier assignment, the On Time Piers cell is highlighted in yellow, however flights can be saved without an On Time Pier assignment.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Status Column</span> – The last column of the grid is a status column. This has the following values/states:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="SubBullet_1"><span class="Bold">DELETE</span> – Gray Text – The row has been marked for deletion but not yet saved (actually deleted)</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1"><span class="Bold">INVALID</span> – Highlighted Red – There is a problem with one or more cells in the row (e.g. the open time is after the close time, the Open time has not been entered, etc.).</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1"><span class="Bold">NEW</span> – Gray Text – A new row has been added, but not yet saved.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1"><span class="Bold">MODIFIED</span> – Gray Text – The row has been modified in some way, but not yet saved.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1"><span class="Bold">SAVED</span> – Green Text – The row has been saved to the server.</li>

        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Shifting Flight Times</span> – The Scheduled Departure flight time can be shifted for any selected rows. If multiple flights are selected, the specific flights that are affected can be displayed or hidden. Changed flights will be updated in the grid with a MODIFIED status until changes are saved.</li>

        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Sending Flights to the Active Flight Schedule</span> – One or more rows can be sent to the active flight schedule. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">

            <li class="SubBullet_1">Flights will be copied to the active flight schedule regardless of the effective and discontinue dates as well as the days of the week the flight operates on.</li>
            <li class="SubBullet_1">If there are multiple flights with the same flight number selected, only the last flight in the selection will be copied to the active flight schedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">None of the actions performed in the grid or commands performed will be saved to the server until <span class="Bold">Save All</span> is selected. Flights with unsaved changes cannot be sent to the active flight schedule. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Note that any rows with a Status of INVALID will not be saved until the row is corrected. Once the save is complete, the Status of all the saved rows will change to SAVED.</p>
