        <h2 class="Heading2">Virtual to Physical Mapping</h2>
        <p class="BodyText">Pier assignments are managed through a Virtual to Physical Pier mapping table. Instead of assigning a flight to a physical pier (which could become unavailable), flights are assigned to a virtual pier. Usually the virtual pier destinations are identical to the physical pier destinations (e.g. the virtual pier "MU01" would be assigned to the physical pier "MU01"). However, in cases of equipment failure, flight cancellations, etc. all bags can be easily rerouted by "remapping" the "MU01" virtual pier to another physical pier (e.g. MU02). </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Virtual Pier Assignments are also used by the system to handle special cases such as No Read bags. These special virtual piers cannot be assigned to a flight, but they can be assigned to route bags to a specific destination. For example, in a system that has a Manual Encoding Station, any "No Read" or "Reject" bags are normally sent to the MEC, but these locations could also be re-mapped elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Special Virtual Piers are configured by the system administrator and may include the following:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">GlobalEarly</span> – This is the virtual sort destination for any bags that are checked in during the "early" time-period (i.e. before the flight's open time) if an Early Pier is not assigned to the flight.

        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">GlobalLate</span> – This in the virtual sort destination for any bags that are checked in during the "late" time-period (i.e. after a flight's late time but before a flight's close time) if a Late Pier is not assigned to the flight. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">For more information, see section <MadCap:xref href="Flight Times.htm#_Ref443913473" class="ParaTextOnly">4.3.1 Flight Times</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
