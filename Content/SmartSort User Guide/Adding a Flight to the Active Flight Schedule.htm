        <p class="Subheading" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Pier Assignments</p>
        <p class="BodyText" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Each flight is assigned to one or more piers so that bags can be sorted to their proper destination. The flight's On Time Pier is required or a warning and alarm will be generated indicating there are flights that do not have a pier assignment. If a flight's time-based pier is not defined, a bag for that flight will sort to the On Time Pier. For example, an early bag will go to the Early Pier if it is defined; otherwise the bag will sort to the On Time Pier. </p>
        <p class="BodyText" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Other time-based pier types can be added and used to sort bags based on the flight's scheduled departure time. Some systems have other types that are not time-based (e.g. reroute or transfer). These pier assignments sort bags based on other characteristics.</p>
        <p class="BodyText" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Pier assignments can also be assigned criteria. If a station and/or class criteria is added to a pier assignment, only bags matching those criteria will sort to the pier. If there are multiple piers of the same type with the same criteria, only the first one created will be used. There is no round-robin on flight piers.</p>

            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Station</span> – If multiple stations have been set up for a flight's route, they can be selected for this field to provide additional sort possibilities. Piers can be set up to sort bags going to different downline stations using this field (e.g. to separate terminating from transfer bags at the end of the next flight leg).</li>
            <li class="Bullet_1"><span class="Bold">Class</span> – Piers can be set up to sort bags in different classes (e.g. Business Class, Premium, etc.) to different sort destinations using this field. The value entered must match the airlines class designations as sent in a BSM (e.g. Y = Economy for Airline XYZ, so the class would be specified as Y in this field).</li>
